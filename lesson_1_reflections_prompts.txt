How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced? It helped to easily find which lines had been changed

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term? If you introduce bugs into your program, you can easily go back and restore the old version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does? A pro is that you can save your work at a logical stopping point. A con is that you may forget to commit, meaning you end up having to commit later and making it too large.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately? Git is more for programmers, while Google Docs can be used for many different purposes.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files? To show changes that you've made while working

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something? You know that you can always revert your work back to a previous working condition.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for? For my own personal programs
