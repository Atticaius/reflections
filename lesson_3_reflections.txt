Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another? Forks are clones of another person's GitHub repository. Clones are your own work, and can be either local or on GitHub. Branches are stored locally. You use forks when modifying someone else's project, clones when working on different machines, and branches when working on your own.
